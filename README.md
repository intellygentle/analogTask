### You will deploy smartcontract and d verify it to complete the tasks. 
### Once you get it done the first time, you'll find it easy running it everyday 
### LET'S DO IT !
### First you need sepolia address. You will need to ask for this from friends.
### create alchemy account though because you may need it for other updates 
### https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
### When a friend has sent you sepoliaEth. follow the guide below to change your network.
